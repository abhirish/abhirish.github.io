Welcome. I am Golub Capital Social Impact, Post Doctoral Fellow in Marketing at Kellogg, Northwestern. \

I am currently on the academic job market.

My interest lies in charitable giving, sharing economy, and influencer marketing. I use methods in machine learning, causal inference, and empirical IO. 
I have been extremely fortunate to work with firms working in charitable giving space and use their proprietary data for my research projects.

Please find my CV [here](http://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhirish/abhirish.github.io/master/_pages/CV.pdf). Please feel free to reach out to me to talk about research!
