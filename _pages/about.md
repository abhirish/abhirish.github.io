Welcome. I am Golub Capital Social Impact, Post Doctoral Fellow in Marketing at Kellogg, Northwestern. 

My interest lies in charitable giving, sharing economy, and influencer marketing. I use methods in machine learning, causal inference, and empirical IO. 
I have been extremely fortunate to work with firms working in charitable giving space and use their proprietary data for my research projects.

**I am currently on the academic job market.**
