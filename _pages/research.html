<h2><a href="/path/to/paper.pdf" download>Fundraising Outcomes and Donation Frictions</h2>

<p>Some donation platforms (DPs) aim to raise funds for causes with a specified target amount (the goal) and a deadline. In such situations, it is possible that a cause is not fully funded, with the DP sometimes diverting the funds to a different cause rather than returning it to the donors. Donors’ future participation on such a DP is therefore contingent on the outcome of the fundraisers they participate in and how the DP deals with the fundraiser outcome.
Theories in social exchange predict that a donor would reduce future participation in the event of a failure; conversely, commitment inertia would predict no change in future participation. 
In this paper, we investigate the impact of fundraising experiences on donors’ future giving on such a DP. To this end, we use donor and cause-level data from one of the largest donation platforms and leverage an exogenous 
shock to the platform to document that if a donor’s first fundraising experience is a failure (with the money diverted to a different cause), then they are 32.8% more likely to not contribute in the future (i.e., “churn”). 
Further, conditional on donating in the future, they reduce their donation amount by 62%.To understand the mechanism underlying our findings, we conducted a survey on MTurk and found that donors only blame the platform 
and not themselves or other donors for the failed fundraiser. To obtain further substantive implications of our results, we formulate a structural model of a donor’s decision journey and use the estimates of the model 
to examine the efficacy of various churn-reducing tactics. We find a 2.5% increase in retention by using a segment choice architecture, which translates to an extra $2.1M in donations.
